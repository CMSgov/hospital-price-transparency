# Version 2.1 Hospital Price Transparency JSON Data Dictionary - Effective July 1, 2024

Review this entire data dictionary for how to disclose data elements in JSON and find the [JSON schemas here](./schemas/) to begin building your hospital MRF. For an explanation of how to interpret the data element tables, review the [How to Read the Data Dictionary Tables](../../../documentation/HOW_TO_READ_DATA_DICTIONARY.md) information.

## General JSON Instructions

Developers of MRFs should generally consider and adopt established standards and industry norms for JSON files when creating the MRF. For more information on the JSON schema standards visit https://www.json.org/json-en.html, https://json-schema.org/. Additional details and instructions specific to JSON may be found in the [JSON schema](./schemas/). Below are additional reminders to avoid common errors in MRFs:

- Encode valid values as instructed below. Values encoded incorrectly will generate a deficiency. For example, insert numeric values only for Payer-Specific Negotiated Charge: Dollar Amount; inserting a dollar sign with a number will generate a deficiency.
- Hospitals are permitted to include additional information through optional data elements that are defined in the data dictionary (e.g., billing class and hospital financial aid policy) or hospital created data attributes. Follow the technical instructions for the defined optional data elements and where to insert hospital defined optional data elements.
- All "Numeric" data elements must be positive numbers. Entering a negative number or "0" will generate a deficiency.
- Ensure all [conditional requirements](#conditional-requirements) are met for an MRF to be considered valid

This data element will contain the numeric representation of the percentage not as a decimal (70.5% is to be entered as “70.5” and not “.705”).

### Additional Notes Concerning Code Types

Hospital items and services may be associated with a variety of billing codes or accounting codes. Examples include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), National Drug Code (NDC), Revenue Center (RC) code, or other common payer identifier. The list of valid values is in the following table with the name of the standard and the associated valid values.

The value "LOCAL" may be used for internal accounting codes in conjunction with another billing code for that item or service. However, if no other code types are available for a particular item or service, "LOCAL" may be used as a valid value.

### Additional Standard Charge Methodology Notes

The `methodology` data element describes the method used by the hospital to establish a payer-specific negotiated charge. Below are descriptions for the valid values for the `methodology` data element and illustrative examples for how to represent unique contracting scenarios in combination with other data elements.

- `case rate`: A flat rate for a package of items and services triggered by a diagnosis, treatment, or condition for a designated length of time.
- `fee schedule`: The payer-specific negotiated charge is based on a fee schedule. Examples of common fee schedules include Medicare, Medicaid, commercial payer, and workers compensation. The dollar amount that is based on the indicated fee schedule should be encoded into the `Payer-specific Negotiated Charge: Dollar Amount` data element. For standard charges based on a percentage of a known fee schedule, the dollar amount should be calculated and encoded in the `Payer-specific Negotiated Charge: Dollar Amount` data element.
- `percent of total billed charges`: The payer-specific negotiated charge is based on a percentage of the total billed charges for an item or service. This percentage may vary depending on certain pre-determined criteria being met.
- `per diem`: The per day charge for providing hospital items and services.
- `other`: If the standard charge methodology used to establish a payer-specific negotiated charge cannot be described by one of the types of standard charge methodology above, select ‘other’ and encode a detailed explanation of the contracting arrangement in the `additional_payer_notes` data attribute.

## Optional Data Attributes

`financial_aid_policy` , `general_contract_provisions` and `billing_class` are optional data attributes. They are not required to be included but instructions have been added to support standardization of disclosure of these data attributes for hospitals that wish to provide more contextual information about their charges. If `financial_aid_policy` or `general_contract_provisions` are included in the MRF, they are to be included to the [root node](#json-data-attributes). If `billing_class` attribute is included in the MRF, it is to be added to the [standard charge object](#standard-charge-object).

| Attribute | Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **financial_aid_policy** | Hospital Financial Aid Policy | String | The hospital’s financial aid policy. See [additional financial aid policy notes](#additional-notes-on-financial_aid_policy) for more details. | No |
| **general_contract_provisions** | General Contract Provisions | Array | An array of `general_contract_provisions` objects for specific payer and plans or across all plans. | No |
| **billing_class** | Billing Class | Enum | The type of billing for the item/service at the established standard charge. The valid values are "professional", "facility", and "both". | No |

### General Contract Provisions Object

| Attribute | Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **payer_name** | Payer Name | String | The name of the third-party payer associated with the contract provisions. | No |
| **plan_name** | Plan Name | String | The name of the payer’s specific plan associated with the contract provisions. | No |
| **provisions** | Provisions | String | Description of contract provisions that are negotiated at an aggregate level across items and services (e.g., claim level). | Yes |

### Additional Notes on `financial_aid_policy`

The hospital’s financial aid policy, also known as charity care or bill forgiveness, that a hospital may choose or be required to apply to a particular individual’s bill. This information may be displayed as either a description or as a link to the financial aid or cash price policy on the hospital’s website.

### Additional Notes on `general_contract_provisions`

This data element can be used to encode payer contract provisions that are applicable at an aggregate level and may include variable items and services. Examples could be "stop loss" provisions or "lesser than" provisions that apply to the claim (as opposed to each item or service on the claim). Multiple general contract provisions across payer and plan combinations can be included in this data element. If a contract provision applies to a specific item or service, use the `standard_charge_algorithm` data element.

## Conditional Requirements

The following conditional requirements must be met for an MRF to be considered valid. These conditional requirements enforce regulatory rules for required data elements, provide flexibility in the development of MRFs, and ensure corresponding information is encoded for items and services to be understandable by the end user.

1. If the "standard charge methodology" encoded value is "other", there must be a corresponding explanation found in the "additional notes" for the associated payer-specific negotiated charge.
1. If an item or service is encoded, a corresponding valid value must be encoded for at least one of the following: "Gross Charge", "Discounted Cash Price", "Payer-Specific Negotiated Charge: Dollar Amount", "Payer-Specific Negotiated Charge: Percentage", "Payer-Specific Negotiated Charge: Algorithm".
1. If there is a "payer specific negotiated charge" encoded as a dollar amount, there must be a corresponding valid value encoded for the deidentified minimum and deidentified maximum negotiated charge data.
