### Guidance related to JSON schema 2.0 and versions

#### [V2.2.0](./V2.2.0_Hospital_price_transparency_schema.json) – January 1, 2025 Implementation date ​

This version of the JSON schema includes all data dictionary technical specifications related to data elements, value encoding, and conditional checks that are required for implementation beginning 7/1/2024 and 1/1/2025. Users of this schema will not have to perform any additional manual changes to their file to meet all data dictionary technical specifications that become effective beginning 7/1/2024 and 1/1/2025. Users should check for errors using the validator tool found here: https://cmsgov.github.io/hpt-tool/

#### [V2.2.1](./V2.2.1_Hospital_price_transparency_schema.json) – Patch to January 1, 2025 Implementation date schema _New – 3/19/2025_

This version is a patch update to the V2.2.0 JSON schema that clarifies the error output when there are issues with how the hospital has encoded the `code_information` object. This optional schema version is recommended as the starting point for hospitals building new JSON machine-readable files (MRFs). Users should check for errors using the validator tool found here: https://cmsgov.github.io/hpt-tool/

**_Hospitals that have properly followed the technical specifications outlined in the V2.2.0 JSON schema will still pass the validator. Hospitals are not required to utilize the V2.2.1 schema._**
